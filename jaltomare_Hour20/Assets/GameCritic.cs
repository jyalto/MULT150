1. Is the game too easy or hard? Give 2 unique reasons why it is easy or hard.

Too hard. The power ups and obstacles are moving too fast the beginning of the game.
Not being able to collect power ups when phased out and the phase lasting as long as it does hurts the player.

2. What 2 changes would you do to make it easier or harder?

The make the game easier, I would start the speed of the collectables slower and then make them travel faster as the game progresses.
I would change the phase out to a toggle where the player instead of having a cooldown for using it, would turn it on to skip an obstacle and immediately turn it back off to gather a power up.

3. List 2 things that would give it a "wow" factor.

Syncing the collectables to travel at the same rate as the floor would look better. 
I would also add feedback to the player contacting the collectables. Play a sound? A visual? 
I would also add a counter to the number of power up a player collected. 

4. What 2 parts of the game are fun? 

The dodging part of the game feels good. The character moves back and forth quickly
The track and lighted side rails look pretty cool.

5. What 2 parts of the game are tedious?

It's hard to tell when you successfully grab a power up so the player has to keep glancing at the timer to see if they got more time.
At times the collectables don't spread themselves out very well and it can be hard to grab anything before the timer runs out. 
 
Changes made:

Obstacle prefab: Changed to a banana. The brown spots will get you!
Powerup prefab: Changed to a Cheeseburger and make the particle system into a flat rotation of particles that orbit the burger.
