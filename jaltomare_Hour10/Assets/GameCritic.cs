    1. Is the game too easy or hard?

        I think Chaos Ball is a little too easy. 3 out od 4 of my balls made it to the goals without my help.
        
    2. What Would make it easier or harder?

        To make it harder I would change it so that the player's bumper had to interact with the colored ball at least once to activate the goal.

    3. What would give it wow factor?

        Something that would give it a wow factor would be if the ball and goal gave feedback when they interacted beyond just diappearing. Explosion? 

    4. What parts of the game are fun? What parts of the game are tedious?

        I enjoyed the chaos part of Chaos Ball. The little balls falying around were cute. 
        The only thing I thought was tedious was when the colored balls lost speed too much. 
        It would be more fun if the player had the option to speed the colored ball a little bit. 

    Additions:
    -Timer that lets the player know how long their game was
    -Variations on Chaos Balls (Larger, faster)
    -A goal for the chaos balls that disappears when they are all gone
    -Grassy pillars to add more challenge to manuvering
